	abstract = {Respondent driven sampling (RDS) is an approach to sampling design utilizing the networks of social relationships that connect members of the target population to facilitate sampling by chain referral methods. Although this leads to biased sampling (such as over-sampling participants with many acquaintances), most RDS studies typically measure each participant's degree, and under the fundamental RDS assumption (that the probability to sample an individual is proportional to his degree) use inverse-probability weighting in an attempt to correct for this bias. However, this assumption is tenuous at best, and should be avoided. Here we suggest a completely novel approach for inference in RDS which compensates for such problems by using a rich source of information that is usually ignored - the precise timing of recruitment. Our new approach, adapting methods developed for inference in epidemic processes, also allows us to develop new estimators for properties such as the prevalence of a disease and the total population size, as well as to test the assumption of recruitment proportional to degree. We find these estimators asymptotically consistent and normally distributed. This new approach thus has the potential to greatly improve the utility of data collected using RDS.},

	abstract = {Estimating the size of stigmatized, hidden, or hard-to-reach populations is a major problem in epidemiology, demography, and public health research. Capture-recapture and multiplier methods have become standard tools for inference of hidden population sizes, but they require independent random sampling of target population members, which is rarely possible. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is a survey method for hidden populations that relies on social link tracing. The RDS recruitment process is designed to spread through the social network connecting members of the target population. In this paper, we show how to use network data revealed by RDS to estimate hidden population size. The key insight is that the recruitment chain, timing of recruitments, and network degrees of recruited subjects provide information about the number of individuals belonging to the target population who are not yet in the sample. We use a computationally efficient Bayesian method to integrate over the missing edges in the subgraph of recruited individuals. We validate the method using simulated data and apply the technique to estimate the number of people who inject drugs in St. Petersburg, Russia.},

	abstract = {Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) is an increasingly popular chain-referral sampling method. Although it has proved effective at generating samples of hard to reach populations—meaning populations for which sampling frames are not available because they are hidden or socially stigmatized like sex workers or injecting drug users—quickly and cost-effectively, the ease of collecting the sample comes with a cost: bias or inefficiency in the estimates of population parameters (Gile \& Handcock, 2010; Goel \& Salganik, 2010). One way that RDS can produce inefficient estimates is if one or more of the recruitment chains gets stuck among members of a cohesive subpopulation, preventing the RDS sampling process from exploring other areas of the network. If that happens, members of the population subgroup recruit one another repeatedly, leading to an increase in sample size without increasing the diversity of the sample. This type of stickiness is particularly likely when hidden populations are stratified, and the stratified groups are organized into venues that provide opportunities to recruit other members of the same stratum. Female sex workers (FSW) in China, who are stratified into tiers of sex work that are correlated with marital status, age, and risk behaviors, are a prime example (Merli et al., 2014; Yamanis et al., 2013). Chinese FSW recruit clients from venues such as karaoke bars, massage parlors, or street corners. At larger venues, sex workers who participate in an RDS study might recruit other members of the same venue into the study at a higher rate than expected, leading to inefficient estimates. In short, the chain could get stuck in a venue.},

As an alternative, we introduce a model-assisted approach, resulting in a design-based estimator leveraging a working network model. We derive a new class of estimators for population means and a corresponding bootstrap standard error estimator. We demonstrate improved performance compared with existing estimators, including adjustment for an initial convenience sample.

	abstract = {Respondent-Driven Sampling (RDS) is n approach to sampling design and inference in hard-to-reach human populations. It is often used in situations where the target population is rare and/or stigmatized in the larger population, so that it is prohibitively expensive to contact them through the available frames. Common examples include injecting drug users, men who have sex with men, and female sex workers. Most analysis of RDS data has focused on estimating aggregate characteristics, such as disease prevalence. However, RDS is often conducted in settings where the population size is unknown and of great independent interest. This paper presents an approach to estimating the size of a target population based on data collected through RDS. The proposed approach uses a successive sampling approximation to RDS to leverage information in the ordered sequence of observed personal network sizes. The inference uses the Bayesian framework, allowing for the incorporation of prior knowledge. A flexible class of priors for the population size is used that aids elicitation. An extensive simulation study provides insight into the performance of the method for estimating population size under a broad range of conditions. A further study shows the approach also improves estimation of aggregate characteristics. Finally, the method demonstrates sensible results when used to estimate the size of known networked populations from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, and when used to estimate the size of a hard-to-reach population at high risk for HIV.},

Men were tested for HIV, syphilis serology using Rapid Plasma Reagin and enzyme immunoassay, and Chlamydia and gonorrhoea using urine polymerase chain reaction. Results We recruited 683 men. Median age was 26 years; 59.4\% were single. The prevalence of HIV was 7.5\% (95\% CI 5.2–10.0), of positive syphilis serology was 6.1\% (95\% CI 4.3–8.1), of Chlamydia was 1.1\% (95\% CI 0.4–2.0), and of gonorrhea was 1.2\% (95\% CI 0.1–1.2). Many men (67.8\%) had both casual and regular partners, sex with other men (8.7\%), and commercial sex (33.1\%). Factors associated with having HIV included reporting a genital ulcer (odds ratio (OR) =2.4, 95\% CI 1.4–4.4), drinking alcohol during last sex (OR 2.0, 95\% CI 1.1–3.7), having 4–6 lifetime partners (OR 2.2, 95\% CI 1.0–4.8), and having one's last female partner be \${\textgreater}\$24 years of age (OR 2.8, 95\% CI 1.2–6.6).

This network has a small HIV epidemic potential but is compatible with the transmission of bacterial sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as syphilis, which are less susceptible to structural breaks in transmission of infection. Our results suggest that policies that force commercial sex underground could have an adverse effect on the spread of HIV and other STIs.},

	abstract = {We explore the network coverage of a sample of female sex workers (FSWs) in China recruited through Respondent Drive Sampling (RDS) as part of an effort to evaluate the claim of RDS of population representation with empirical data. We take advantage of unique information on the social networks of FSWs obtained from two overlapping studies – RDS and a venue-based sampling approach (PLACE) – and use an exponential random graph modeling (ERGM) framework from local networks to construct a likely network from which our observed RDS sample is drawn. We then run recruitment chains over this simulated network to assess the assumption that the RDS chain referral process samples participants in proportion to their degree and the extent to which RDS satisfactorily covers certain parts of the network. We find evidence that, contrary to assumptions, RDS oversamples low degree nodes and geographically central areas of the network. Unlike previous evaluations of RDS which have explored the performance of RDS sampling chains on a non-hidden population, or the performance of simulated chains over previously mapped realistic social networks, our study provides a robust, empirically grounded evaluation of the performance of RDS chains on a real-world hidden population.},

	abstract = {Background Human populations are structured by social networks, in which individuals tend to form relationships based on shared attributes. Certain attributes that are ambiguous, stigmatized or illegal can create a ÔhiddenÕ population, so-called because its members are difficult to identify. Many hidden populations are also at an elevated risk of exposure to infectious diseases. Consequently, public health agencies are presently adopting modern survey techniques that traverse social networks in hidden populations by soliciting individuals to recruit their peers, e.g., respondent-driven sampling (RDS). The concomitant accumulation of network-based epidemiological data, however, is rapidly outpacing the development of computational methods for analysis. Moreover, current analytical models rely on unrealistic assumptions, e.g., that the traversal of social networks can be modeled by a Markov chain rather than a branching process. Methodology/Principal Findings Here, we develop a new methodology based on stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs), which are well-suited to modeling tree-like structure of the RDS recruitment process. We apply this methodology to an RDS case study of injection drug users (IDUs) in Tijuana, México, a hidden population at high risk of blood-borne and sexually-transmitted infections (i.e., HIV, hepatitis C virus, syphilis). Survey data were encoded as text strings that were parsed using our custom implementation of the inside-outside algorithm in a publicly-available software package (HyPhy), which uses either expectation maximization or direct optimization methods and permits constraints on model parameters for hypothesis testing. We identified significant latent variability in the recruitment process that violates assumptions of Markov chain-based methods for RDS analysis: firstly, IDUs tended to emulate the recruitment behavior of their own recruiter; and secondly, the recruitment of like peers (homophily) was dependent on the number of recruits. Conclusions SCFGs provide a rich probabilistic language that can articulate complex latent structure in survey data derived from the traversal of social networks. Such structure that has no representation in Markov chain-based models can interfere with the estimation of the composition of hidden populations if left unaccounted for, raising critical implications for the prevention and control of infectious disease epidemics.},

	abstract = {Methods for standard errors and confidence intervals for nonlinear statistics {\textbackslash}texttheta{\textasciicircum}–such as ratios, regression, and correlation coefficients–have been extensively studied for stratified multistage designs in which the clusters are sampled with replacement, in particular, the important special case of two sampled clusters per stratum. These methods include the customary linearization (or Taylor) method and resampling methods based on the jackknife and balanced repeated replication (BRR). Unlike the jackknife or the BRR, the linearization method is applicable to general sampling designs, but it involves a separate variance formula for each nonlinear statistic, thereby requiring additional programming efforts. Both the jackknife and the BRR use a single variance formula for all nonlinear statistics, but they are more computing-intensive. The resampling methods developed here retain these features of the jackknife and the BRR, yet permit extension to more complex designs involving sampling without replacement. The sampling designs studied include (a) stratified cluster sampling in which the clusters are sampled with replacement, (b) stratified simple random sampling without replacement, (c) unequal probability sampling without replacement, and (d) two-stage cluster sampling with equal probabilities and without replacement. Our proposed resampling methods may be viewed as extensions to complex survey samples of the bootstrap, and in the case of design (c), of the BRR as well. We obtain and study the properties of variance estimators of {\textbackslash}texttheta{\textasciicircum} and confidence intervals for the parameter of interest {\textbackslash}texttheta, based on the bootstrap histogram of the t statistic. The variance estimators reduce to the standard ones in the special case of linear statistics. These confidence intervals take account of the skewness in the distribution of {\textbackslash}texttheta{\textasciicircum}, unlike the intervals based on the normal approximation. For case (a), the sampled clusters are resampled in each stratum independently by simple random sampling with replacement, and this procedure is replicated many times. The estimate for each resampled cluster is properly scaled such that the resulting variance estimator of {\textbackslash}texttheta{\textasciicircum} reduces to the standard unbiased variance estimator in the linear case. For case (b), the sampled units are resampled in each stratum as in case (a), but a different scaling is used. Different resampling procedures and scalings are employed for case (c). A two-stage resampling procedure is developed for case (d). Results of a simulation study under a stratified simple random design show that the bootstrap intervals track the nomial error rate in each tail better than the intervals based on the normal approximation, but the bootstrap variance estimators are less stable than those based on the linearization or the jackknife.},

	abstract = {Web crawling, snowball sampling, and respondent-driven sampling (RDS) are three types of network driven sampling techniques that are popular when it is difficult to contact individuals in the population of interest. This paper studies network driven sampling as a Markov process on the social network that is indexed by a tree. Each node in this tree corresponds to an observation and each edge in the tree corresponds to a referral. Indexing with a tree, instead of a chain, allows for the sampled units to refer multiple future units into the sample. In survey sampling, the design effect characterizes the additional variance induced by a novel sampling strategy. If the design effect is DE, then constructing an estimator from the novel design makes the variance of the estimator DE times greater than it would be under a simple random sample. Under certain assumptions on the referral tree, the design effect of network driven sampling has a critical threshold that is a function of the referral rate \$m\$ and the clustering structure in the social network, represented by the second eigenvalue of the Markov transition matrix, \$\${\textbackslash}backslash\$lambda\_2\$. If \$m \${\textless}\$ 1/\${\textbackslash}backslash\$lambda\_2{\textasciicircum}2\$, then the design effect is finite (i.e. the standard estimator is \$\${\textbackslash}backslash\$sqrt\{n\}\$-consistent). However, if \$m \${\textgreater}\$ 1/\${\textbackslash}backslash\$lambda\_2{\textasciicircum}2\$, then the design effect grows with \$n\$ (i.e. the standard estimator is no longer \$\${\textbackslash}backslash\$sqrt\{n\}\$-consistent). Past the critical threshold, the estimator converges at the slower rate of \$\${\textbackslash}backslash\$log\_m \${\textbackslash}backslash\$lambda\_2\$. The Markov model allows for nodes to be resampled. Under certain conditions, the rate of resampling is not affected by the critical threshold, so long as \$n = o(\${\textbackslash}backslash\$sqrt\{N\})\$, where \$n\$ is the sample size and \$N\$ is the population size.},

Four populations were simulated using different random graph models. Each population was “infected” using four different transmission processes. From each combination of population x transmission, one thousand samples were obtained using a RDS-like sampling strategy. Three estimators were used to predict the population-level prevalence of the “infection”. Several types of misreported degrees were simulated. Also, samples were generated using the standard random sampling method and the respective prevalence estimates, using the classical frequentist estimator. Estimation biases in relation to population parameters were assessed, as well as the variance. Variability was associated with the connectivity characteristics of each simulated population. Clustered populations yield greater variability and no RDS-based strategy could address the estimation biases. Misreporting degrees had modest effects, especially when RDS estimators were used. The best results for RDS-based samples were observed when the “infection” was randomly attributed, without any relation with the underlying network structure.},

We compared the populations of sex workers recruited by the venue-based Priorities for Local AIDS Control Efforts (PLACE) method and a concurrently implemented network-based sampling method, respondent-driven sampling (RDS), in Liuzhou, China. Methods For the PLACE protocol, all female workers at a stratified random sample of venues identified as places where people meet new sexual partners were interviewed and tested for syphilis. Female workers who reported sex work in the past 4 weeks were categorised as FSWs. RDS used peer recruitment and chain referral to obtain a sample of FSWs. Data were collected between October 2009 and January 2010. We compared the socio-demographic characteristics and the percentage with a positive syphilis test of FSWs recruited by PLACE and RDS. Results The prevalence of a positive syphilis test was 24\% among FSWs recruited by PLACE and 8.5\% among those recruited by RDS and tested (prevalence ratio 3.3; 95\% CI 1.5 to 7.2). Socio-demographic characteristics (age, residence and monthly income) also varied by sampling method. PLACE recruited fewer FSWs than RDS (161 vs 583), was more labour-intensive and had difficulty gaining access to some venues. RDS was more likely to recruit from areas near the RDS office and from large low prevalence entertainment venues. Conclusions Surveillance protocols using different sampling methods can obtain different estimates of prevalence and population characteristics. Venue-based and network-based methods each have strengths and limitations reflecting differences in design and assumptions. We recommend that more research be conducted on measuring bias in bio-behavioural surveillance.},

	abstract = {People ﬁnd jobs through their social networks using ties of different strengths. Intuitively weak ties might be less useful because people communicate less often with them, or more useful because they provide novel information. Granovetter’s early work showed that more job-seekers get help via acquaintances than friends (Granovetter, 1973). However, recent work on job-ﬁnding (Gee et al., 2017) shows an apparent paradox of weak ties in the United States: most people are helped through one of their numerous weak ties, but a single stronger tie is signiﬁcantly more valuable at the margin. Although some studies have addressed the importance of weak ties in job ﬁnding within speciﬁc countries, this is the ﬁrst paper to use a single dataset and methodology to compare the importance of weak ties across countries. Here, we use de-identiﬁed data from almost 17 million social ties in 55 countries to document the widespread existence of this paradox of weak ties across many societies. More people get jobs where their weak ties work. However, this is not because weak ties are more helpful than strong ties – it is because they are more numerous. In every country, the likelihood of going to work where an individual friend works is increasing –not decreasing – with tie strength. Yet, there is substantial variation in the added value of a strong tie at the margin across these countries. We show that the level of income inequality in a country is positively correlated with the added value of a strong tie, so that individual strong ties matter more when there is greater income inequality.},
