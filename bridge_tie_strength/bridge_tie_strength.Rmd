## Introduction 

The theory of weak ties puts forth that are aquaintances (weak ties) are more likely to be the the crucial ties (bridges) that connect two individuals from distinct closely-knitted social groups. In this capactity, the bridges serve as an important way for simple contagions to spread within a network. This paper investigates the strength of local bridges within a series of 74 networks of social connection in Indian villages, using two distinct definitions of a tie strength. Empirical evidence is found in support of the theory that bridges are disporportianately weak ties.

Central to Granovetter (1973) theory of weak ties is the idea that bridges are important channels for the flow of communication within networks. He claims that local bridges, unlike the strong ties within tightly-knit clusters, tend to be disproportiantely weak ties. This paper assess the claim that weak ties are bridges, finding strong evidence that bridges are disproportianately weak ties.

Past work has empirially shown that bridge are weak ties. Friedkin (1980) collected analyzed a social network of biologists, finding support for Granovetters theory. The importance of bridges is debated, but there has been considerable evidence that information diffuses through weak ties. 

## Data

I analyze a set of 75 social networks collected in Southern India first collected by Banerjee et al. (2013) to assess the diffusion of microfinance products. The 75 networks, collected across 5 districts in Karnataka, are a median distance of 46 kilometers apart from their closest neighboring village [@gee_paradox_2017]. The data was collected within each village under the assumption that each village was a distinct system, and network data was collected within villages and not between them. 

First, a household-level census was administered collecting data on characteristics of the household (roof type, access to electricity, etc.) and information on household head. The household census did not collect information on social networks. After the household-level census was completed, an individual questionnaire was administered in each village. Individual questionnaires were administered to households with a woman   between ages 18-50. The individual level questionnaire was administered in all Christian and Muslim households, and Hindu househoulds were clustered by geography and then 50% of households were randomly sampled. Once elegible households were selected, the individual questionnaire was administered to the household head, the spouse of the household head, other women ages 18-50, and their spouses. 

The individual questionnaire contained a module asking respondents about 12 different dimensions of social relationships: 

1. Borrow money from
2. Give advice to
3. Help with a decision
4. Borrow kerosene or rice from
5. Lend kerosene or rice to
6. Lend money to
7. Obtain medical advice from
8. Engage socially with
9. Are related to
10. Go to temple with
11. Invite to one's home
12. Visit in another's home

An additional module was administered to a sample of those individuals asking about age, religion, caste, etc. 

@Banarjee created used the information collected on the social relationship module to create a set of 74 undirected networks, one for each village. The decision to create an undirected network was made as the authors were primarily interested in communication, TODO. So, a certain tie exists between two individuals even if only one individual reports that social relationship. Reciprocity is an important component of any relationship, and defintiely an important component of measuring tie strength, so obtaining a directed version of this dataset could be valuable. 

## Methods

Two distinct definitions of tie strength were used in this analysis. The first definition of tie stength is
